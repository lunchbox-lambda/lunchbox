# Lunchbox Î» \ node-red

Integration with the Node-RED flow ecosystem. This repo contains the preconfigured flows for the dashboard UI and a separate data flow to customize events / notifications. The library will be loaded by the [brain](https://github.com/lunchbox-lambda/brain.git) during initialization. The flow designer and the dashboard is served from __/red__ and __/red/dashboard__ respectively.
